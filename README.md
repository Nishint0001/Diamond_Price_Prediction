Diamond Price Prediction Project

Description
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and depth. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains information about diamonds, including their characteristics and corresponding prices. By applying machine learning algorithms to this dataset, we can build a predictive model to estimate the price of diamonds based on their features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project has includes the following features:

Carat: Weight of the diamond (numeric).
Cut: Quality of the cut (categorical - Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
Color: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best) (categorical).
Clarity: A measurement of how clear the diamond is (categorical).
Depth: Total depth percentage (numeric).
Table: Width of top of diamond relative to the widest point (numeric).
Price: Price in US dollars (numeric).
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

artifacts/: Contains artifacts generated during model training, such as trained model files and evaluation results.
data/: Contains the dataset files (e.g., diamonds.csv).
src/: Source code for the project, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
templates/: HTML templates for any web-based visualization or frontend components (if applicable).
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.





Usage
Explore the data in the data/ directory and use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data exploration and preprocessing.

Run the Python scripts in the src/ directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Use the HTML templates in the templates/ directory for web-based visualization (if applicable).

The trained models and evaluation results will be saved in the artifacts/ directory.
